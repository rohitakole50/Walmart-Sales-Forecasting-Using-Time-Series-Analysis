# Walmart-Sales-Forecasting-Using-Time-Series-Analysis

## Detailed Description:

This repository contains a comprehensive project on sales forecasting for Walmart using time series analysis and various machine learning techniques. The project aims to build robust models to predict future sales, helping Walmart optimize inventory management, revenue projections, and investment strategies. The repository includes a detailed final report documenting the entire process.

### Walmart Sales Forecasting Model Using SAS Studio

This report provides an end-to-end solution for forecasting Walmart sales using time series analysis. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation using SAS Studio 3.8. The project demonstrates the use of ARIMAX models to account for seasonality and trends in the sales data.

## Report Breakdown:

* **Abstract:** Overview of the project, highlighting the use of SAS Studio for time series exploration and ARIMAX modeling on the Walmart sales dataset.
* **Executive Summary:** Detailed explanation of the data merging process, feature engineering, and aggregation techniques used. It also discusses the creation of bins and models for different store sizes and the identification of seasonal patterns.
* **Business Case:** Justification for the project, emphasizing the importance of accurate sales forecasting for inventory management, revenue projection, and investment strategies in the competitive retail industry.
* **Dataset Schema:** Description of the dataset, including the various features such as monthly sales, fuel prices, temperature, unemployment, and markdowns.
* **Time Series Exploration:** Analysis of seasonal trends and significant sales spikes during holiday seasons, along with the necessity of prewhitening variables like temperature.
* **Modeling and Forecasting:** Comparison of different models, including ARIMAX and SARIMA, and the impact of prewhitening on model accuracy. The section covers the development and evaluation of models for different bins.
* **Findings:** Summary of key insights, including the necessity of prewhitening certain variables, the importance of holiday data, and the accuracy of the final ARIMAX models. The models demonstrate an accuracy of 80-90%, providing robust predictions for sales forecasting.
* **Business Case Recommendations:** Suggestions for optimizing marketing efforts, inventory management, and sales strategies based on the analysis. Recommendations include capitalizing on seasonal variations, planning around holiday sales, and developing strategies to counteract post-holiday sales drops.

## Additional Information:

* **Dataset:** The dataset used in this project is sourced from a comprehensive Walmart sales dataset available on Kaggle.
* **Tools and Libraries:** The report utilizes SAS Studio for data processing, time series analysis, and model building.
* **Objective:** The primary objective is to develop accurate sales forecasting models to help Walmart optimize its operations and maintain a competitive edge in the retail industry.
